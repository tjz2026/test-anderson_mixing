Dear Katja,
How are you doing? Recently I received a letter from Mr. Breitenstr√§ter. I am aware of the rapidly increasing cost of energy and utility, and completely understand the decision regarding the rent. As a matter of fact, my wife and I always appreciate all the kind help we received from you and your husband, and we had a lot of good memory living here for our little family of three in the past years.

It is no doubt that your request reflected the economic reality and is absolutely reasonable in the market, and we are very much willing to make more contributions on top of our previous contract, however, I am afraid I have to be very honest that it is very difficult for us to manage to pay with the specific amount from your letter in the near future, as the whole income of my family solely comes from my salary and such budget for the rent would be beyond the limit of our current financial capability.

If you don't mind, may I make some proposals? Is it possible that besides a certain
amount of rent increase, we could also take care of all the utility bills by ourselves and make a new lease contract, or could you consider making a temporary reduction of the increase you requested for a limited period of time and afterward we will pay more as we do better financially? We are also open to any other proposals and see if we can manage.

As for the repairing cost, we have no problem paying for those we are responsible for,
although we would like to have an idea of a rough estimation of the amount. Still, we would like to clarify that the defect of the washbasin existed before we moved in and we took a photo of it back then and thought this was not a minor matter and did not discuss this with you.

We would deeply appreciate it if you could kindly consider our request and offer us some new options. Last but not least, no matter what your decision would be, we want to thank you again for all your kindness to us in the past three years and wish you and your family all the best in the future.

Have a nice weekend!

Sincerely,
yours,
Family Tang
